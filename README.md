# STEM-Assignment-Checker-GUI

# Objective:
The objective is to enhance the efficiency of the assignment feedback process by implementing a GUI system that automates feedback mechanisms, reduces feedback time significantly, and provides a foundation for potential AI/ML model training and future automation, thereby improving workflow productivity and user experience.

# Scope
The GUI facilitates real-time monitoring of assignment processing, empowering workflow adjustments for optimal efficiency. It drastically reduces assignment feedback time from 10 minutes to 1 minute, enhancing user experience and productivity. It serves as a vital data source for AI/ML model training, setting the stage for future feedback system automation and efficiency improvements.

# Repository Structure
GUI_Checker_Code/: Includes the Python script for automating the feedback mechanism and generating data for further AI/ML models. Also includes the GUI bat.

Files/: Placeholder for any data files required by the application.

Graphics/: Images and logo files related to the project.
